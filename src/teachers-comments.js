Therefore, we recommend continuous practice at home as she still needs stability in most of the concepts taught in the past weeks. Well done, Kaima! Keep striving to be the best. Have a nice break.",

Her dedication and drive over the last few weeks have resulted in these grades. However, her reading and penmanship skills are work-in-progress and we will keep pushing her to get the best in achieving them, as more activities will be introduced in the next half to help boost her reading and writing skills. Keep soaring! Amanda and enjoy your midterm break.",

This first half as seen Chiagozie being more interactive, sociable and continuously springing out of her shell, this attitude has earned her amazing grades and we are so proud of her. Kudos Chiagozie!  Keep ascending to the top and do have a lovely break.",

      " We have enjoyed being Nicole’s teachers. She is self-confident and has an excellent manner which has singled her out among her peers. She is also an amiable child who tries to participate in all class activities: although we need to see more courage and boldness exhibited during class discussions. Nicole is the epitome of greatness, and we are optimistic; she will keep soaring higher with your encouragement. Do enjoy your Christmas holiday.",

During Comprehension class, he reads well, but his handwriting is still a work in progress. He has made significant progress in logic and statistics, but much is still expected of him next term. He always takes his time to complete whatever logical task he is assigned to deliver a good result. We commend his hard work, tenacity and maturity. Thumbs up, Somtochukwu!

However, we would still need to work on his confidence to tackle tasks with a more determined mind. We know he is capable, and we would support him in every area: so that he can always be at the top of his game. Have a fun-filled Christmas break, Obichukwu!",

She sometimes struggles to grasp new ideas, but when she does, she soars to new heights. Congratulations, Ubongabasi; have a wonderful Christmas.",

In the recently completed examination, we had to evaluate him orally, to get the best out of him. Though: he still struggles with reading and comprehension of topics taught, as he is yet to grasp his sounds properly and tap into his potential to unravel his academic prowess but has shown a willingness to learn. It will benefit him immensely if there is constant follow-up. Continue to work hard, Success; do not give up your pursuit of excellence. Have a beautiful Christmas holiday.\r\n",

He has a policy of keeping the same pace as the teacher. He makes sure he completes any task given to him before his peers, hence his exemplary character. His lettering and presentation of work are appealing to all who have a good sense of aesthetics. Well done! Daniel. Merry Christmas ahead of time.",

He is a good team player who works at an appropriate pace, neither too quickly nor slowly, resists the urge to be disturbed by peers and avoids mindless errors by paying attention to detail. His assimilation of the topics taught this term is indeed impressive. So far, we are proud of his achievements. Enjoy the Christmas holiday, Melvin! \r\n ",

      " It has been a beautiful experience working with Joseph this term. He has become more deliberate with his academics, which did not start on an encouraging note in the first half of this term. The practical efforts he constantly made to ask questions about concepts he found difficult to process, thereby making him confused, paid off since he has gained confidence and can now interpret a question and explain what it demands of him. We will not relent, as we are optimistic that the star in him will shine. Well done, Joseph. Merry Christmas ahead of time",

However, as much as we are happy with this development, we still look forward to her achieving more in the coming term.

She began by combining three-letter words with the spelling of numerals to become more comfortable writing them. We are pleased that we were able to teach her how to properly blend them: and to use the beginning consonant blends. Her handwriting is also developing. Since there is still considerable space for growth and progress in every area of the curriculum, we will continue to strengthen her learning abilities as we move forward. We will also increase her focus and motivation in the upcoming term.

      "Having Olivia in class has been fantastic. She has shown improvement in her personality this term. Her reasoning skill and willingness to be abreast with her peers have improved. She started by forming three-letter words and simple sentences alongside the first array of tricky words. Her numerical skill was not left out as she could numerate 1-10 and do simple arithmetic. Nevertheless, We will continue to work on her concentration span, reading stability, and comprehension skills, as home support is advisable for her to meet up with the class challenges and be at grade level. Keep making progress, Olivia, and enjoy your Christmas holiday.",

He knows the appropriate register to use in any conversion, and his diction and confidence are impressive. He has shown encouraging progress in his academics but needs to improve his spelling. We do, however, assist him with our syllabic spelling chart to achieve spontaneous improvement. Well done, Araoluwa. Merry Christmas ahead of time",

She is friendly, enjoys creating a pleasant and conversational atmosphere during lessons, and has put forth an impressive effort in her studies. However, we will continue to work with her to maximise the use of her time in completing her assigned while putting more effort towards achieving a better grasp of logic and statistics and other weaker subjects.

He has developed a commendable work habit, though we urge him to shun distractions while learning is ongoing. Nonetheless, we will keep encouraging him to put in more effort towards completing his assigned tasks within the allotted time while working with him to enable him to achieve a better grasp of logic, statistics, and self-composture. We hope to see more improvements as we journey into the second term. Ikemsinachi, more is expected of you. Have a fabulous Christmas holiday. \r\n",

Although he could be easily distracted, he is making good progress in reading and spelling, and he enjoys outdoor activities and working in smaller groups. We encourage him to keep up the right attitude to learning for excellent grades ahead. Do have a wonderful Christmas holiday.    ",

He has developed consistent work habits, and his attitude towards all assigned tasks is commendable. However, we will keep encouraging him to put in more effort towards completing his assigned tasks within the allotted time while working with him to enable him to achieve a better grasp of logic, statistics, and other weaker subjects. We hope to see more improvements as we journey into the second term. Chidera more is expected of you. Have a fabulous Christmas. ",

When Chizaram expresses herself verbally and in creative writing, she does so with a high degree of imagination and fluency. Have a lovely midterm break, Chizaram. You are a total genius.\r\n",

He asks questions when not clear and never gives up till he has fully grasped the explanations. He is always at his best when solving his class tasks, and it has been a great half term with him.

He has improved in his work organisation and can do some sums correctly and independently. We commend his performance thus far; however, we will continue encouraging him to put in more effort in areas where he needs to improve. Keep up the great work, Chukwuemerie! And enjoy the mid-term break.",

She maintains a positive attitude in class and strives to do her best at all times, which has allowed her to progress steadily throughout the half term. She is increasingly overcoming her aversion to logic as she eagerly attempts all questions to the end, excelling in practically all of them. You did a fantastic job, Jacquelyn!

This term has seen her improve tremendously in her classroom management skills and her relationship with her classmates but yet to reflect fully in her academics. We urge her to put in more effort in her academics especially in mathematics and sciences in order to unleash her full potentials. Well done Chizaram! Do enjoy your break ",

      "Working with Victor this term has been quite a privilege and a pleasure. We are delighted to be his teachers. He has improved in logic and statistics but with a greater expectation of a better performance next term. He takes his time whenever he is given any task in class to turn in a good result. His academic work rate is commendable but still a work in progress as he keeps improving. Also, he reads well during comprehension class, displays maturity, follows through with duties assigned to him, and makes efforts to take responsibility and work independently. Kudos, Victor! Do enjoy the Christmas holiday.",

      ". It has been a wonderful experience working with David this term. He has a positive attitude towards learning. Though, he needs to learn to be bolder and less distracted, which we are conscientiously working on. Nevertheless, his determination has earned him fantastic grades this term, and we are proud of his achievement. Well done, David! Keep ascending, and have a jolly Christmas holiday.\r\n ",

The practical efforts he constantly made to ask questions about concepts he found difficult to process, thereby making him confused, paid off since he has gained confidence and can now interpret a question and explain what it demands of him. We will not relent, as we are optimistic that the star in him will shine. Well done, Joseph. Merry Christmas ahead of time",

She began by combining three-letter words with the spelling of numerals to become more comfortable writing them. We are pleased that we were able to teach her how to properly blend them: and to use the beginning consonant blends. Her handwriting is also developing. Since there is still considerable space for growth and progress in every area of the curriculum, we will continue to strengthen her learning abilities as we move forward. We will also increase her focus and motivation in the upcoming term.

He is a brilliant youngster who takes his time to complete whatever task is assigned to him to produce a good result. His performances in logic, science, and handwriting have improved, but they can still be better as there is room for improvement. He is calm, quiet, and well-composed in class. We salute his behavioural discipline in class and his interactions with his peers. Thumbs up, Jason! Enjoy the midterm break.\r\n",

One of her greatest strengths is her good listening skill; she downloads every piece of information passed across in class, and even when her attention is diverted, she does not lose consciousness because when asked to explain, her answer is always affirmative. Never relent on your oars, Annabel. Have a fantastic midterm break!",

We were unsure about his ability to cope based on the time of admission to the class, but to our greatest surprise, he beat our expectations by becoming one of the brightest, especially in Logic. We truly enjoyed watching him grow into an excellent student, and we are super proud of him. We shall keep strengthening his reading fluency as he moves to the second half of the term. So keep working hard, David and have a fantastic midterm break.\r\n",

She works independently and takes pride in work well done. However, she sometimes needs reminders to use her time effectively and this we would love to see her improve on in the new term. Have a great holiday Ubongabasi, you are a star!\r\n",

However, we would focus more on her work-pace, handwriting and retention capacity so that she can attain her highest potential. Keep the flag high, Chinenyenwa! Have a great Easter.",

Her journey towards improving her reading and spelling skills is still a work in progress as she could only read three letter words in simple sentences, levels one and two of tricky words and phonogram “ai words”. We do hope that before the end of the session, she will overcome her academic fears. However, we will continue to strengthen her comprehension skills as she reads challenging text, and our goal is to make sure all sentences are well understood. Keep striving, Chikaima and enjoy the Easter holiday.\r\n",

      "It has been a joy getting to work with Kosi this term. He is a caring child who is always willing to participate and share insightful ideas. He puts effort into class tasks and tries his best throughout the day. He has been working on becoming an active reader to improve his comprehension. One key area for the last lapse in Year 1 is to focus on reading the words on the page. He often substitutes his own words; while reading, which can alter the meaning he is getting. In writing, he does a fantastic job of adding his personality to his work. Keep it up, Kosi! Do have a fabulous Easter break.",

He contributes intelligently to class discussions and tries to meet up to speed with the class expectations. However, he needs to be more focused in class during lessons, and he is encouraged to keep the flag flying higher even as he proceeds to the last lap of Year 1. Well done, Ugomsinachi!

      "Chiagozie is a loving pupil who has consciously demonstrated virtue in his academics. He makes an effort to master logical concepts and note-taking and has attempted to tackle his classwork and homework independently. However, he is encouraged to take a little more time to form his letters well, so his penmanship can be neat and legible, which would improve his note-taking. Well-done, Chiagozie! There is enough room for improvement. Enjoy the Easter holiday.\r\n \r\n",

      " Working with Emmanuel this term has been a delight. He is making a frantic effort to attain mastery of all subjects and concepts taught. He contributes immensely to our interactive class and has shown his zeal to be part of all class tasks. However, his speed in writing has also affected his effort, but we are quick to restore his confidence, and he believes implicitly that he can be a pacesetter one day. Well done, Emmanuel.Take advantage of the holiday",

      "Working with Zara  this term has been a great pleasure. She is a child with an immaculate character and a robust personality. She is a very reserved child who keeps to herself. She likes to contribute to class discussions and answers the way she understands. Her carriage is worth emulating by her peers. She has made a great effort to be on par with her colleagues, who dictate the pace in class. However, we commend her performance thus far and will keep encouraging and working with her to reach her full potential. Well done, Zara! Have a wonderful Easter holiday.",

She creates a euphoria that sways the opinion of the teachers, freeing herself from reprimand. She has a high intelligence quotient, which helps her analyse subject matter. Among her peers, she is the best analyst in the class. Well done, Chizaram! Take advantage of the Easter holiday",

Her journey towards improving her reading and spelling skills is still a work in progress as she could only read three letter words in simple sentences, level one of the tricky words and only phonogram “ai words”.

He has a great attitude toward work, although he can easily be distracted; he has made commendable progress but needs to double his effort in his weak subjects. We commend his zeal and good grades as we work with him next term to ensure he tackles every activity with a more determined mind. Well done, Kobi! Enjoy your break.",

She appears well-rested and ready for each day&apos;s activities. However, she needs to loosen up, be more outspoken, and increase her pace in class, which we are seriously working on. Go Fareedah!

Her impeccable manners and brilliant leadership skills are highly commendable. Omotese, you have done marvellously so far. Do not relent on this impressive performance as the term progresses. Enjoy your midterm break!",

      "Working with Omotese this term has been incredible, as she is a bright girl with tremendous potential. She is friendly, enjoys creating a pleasant and conversational atmosphere during lessons, and has put forth an impressive effort in her studies. However, we will continue to work with her to maximise the use of her time in completing her assigned tasks, as we hope to see more improvements while sailing smoothly into the second term. You have done a brilliant job, Omotese; do have a splendid Christmas celebration.\r\n \r\n ",
